One review pointed out that the spritz had very little aperol, which was disappointing for a bar of this quality. Another review described the spritz as delicious and complemented by snacks, although it was quite expensive at 27 euros.",True,3,Bar Longhi,"Stylish, old-world hotel cocktail bar with views of the Grand Canal & city landmarks.","Campiello Traghetto, 2467, 30124 Venezia VE, Italy",+39 041 794611,http://www.thegrittipalace.com/longhi-bar-venice,"Very pleasant to have a drink on the pontoon terrace, small downside in a glass of Spritz, very little aperol, just enough for color for the capiirina, the catch cha was not very present, a shame for an establishment of this quality

Had a delicious spritz with complementary almonds, hazelnuts and chips. Having said that, the spritzs were $27 euro a pop, so be prepared, but totally worth it for a thirsty smurf."

El mejor Aperol spritz y m√°s barato!

Todo muy bueno. Los aperol spritz muy buenos y a precio razonable. Los probamos todos. El Hugo diferente y muy bueno. Tienen sachetti t√≠picos y m√°s para comer. √çbamos casi todos los d√≠as. Volveremos.

Very tasty Aperol Spritz that you can enjoy at small tables inside and outside or on the steps of the bridge. Casual atmosphere - a perfect place to end the day.

Excellent experience! Very good and particular cicchetti, of excellent quality. Aperol Spritz really good. Advised!

Very nice price, and nice staff! Good aperol spritz!

The Aperol Spritz is great and the espresso is very tasty. The prices are fair and the man behind the counter is very friendly. Recommended.

Paramos a tomar algo. El limoncelo muy rico y el aperol spritz perfecto üíØ (los precios tambi√©n).
Buen ambiente, buen servicio y buena m√∫sica.
Gran descubrimiento. ‚Ä¶

Aperol spritz for 3 euros!! And excellent

Great aperol spritz and snack bite üôåüèª ‚Ä¶

Fantastic place for aperol spritz and cichetti - great value, lovely food, friendly staff and great location. What more could you ask for?

Great and cheap spritz! Aperol was the best, but Hugo and Select also good! Chicceti very tasty!

This is a great  bar, good cheap food and lovely drinks. Away from the crazy busy main touristy bit, it is worth a visit. We had a variety of cichetti and they were great. Can‚Äôt beat aperol spritz for ‚Ç¨3.

Amazing aperol spritz at 3 Euros each, served by a friendly bartender - seats are free for all with some in the inside of the pub.

Definitely a thirst quencher for those looking to have a pit stop from traversing in the busy street of Venice üçª

Great location with very fair prices! Delicious Aperol Spritz!"
"The reviews indicate that the bar serves Aperol Spritz but not after 9pm, which has disappointed some patrons. Overall, the spritz is considered excellent by many, and the bar is appreciated for its friendly staff and laid-back atmosphere. Some reviewers noted that the bar is less crowded and cheaper than other spots, making it a convenient choice for a quick drink.",True,4,Irish Pub Santa Lucia,"Compact hangout offering beer, sandwiches & snacks in a traditional, unpretentious atmosphere.","Rio Ter√† Lista di Spagna, Campo San Geremia, 282/b, 30121 Venezia VE, Italy",+39 041 524 2880,http://www.irishpubsantalucia.it/,"No Aperol Spritz (the drink of Venice) served after 21:00 . Disappointing.

From my point of view, the Santa Lucia spritz is one of the best you can find.

You can sit there for a drink in the evening, but it's not that comfortable for anything more. But it is also less crowded and cheaper than the ‚Äúhip‚Äù places. We went there quickly for a spritz because it's not too far from the train station.

Too bad they didn't give me an aperol after 9pm

Excelente atenci√≥n, ambiente, y Spritz!!

Good sandwiches and spritz! However, it wouldn't be bad to accompany the spritz with some chips or a few shots! However friendly staff

No spritz after 9pm which is odd and unheard of. Relatively pricey as is most bars around. Very little atmosphere or people about. Would not recommend.

Great bartenders! Shame no Aperol spirits after 9pm,but you can still order other liqueurs, beer and wines. Laid back tradition Irish pub vibe.  Would definatley go back if I ever come back to Venice.

Peque√±o pero acogedor. Perfecto para tomar una cerveza o spritz (antes de las 21:00) y ver f√∫tbol internacional.

The girl behind the counter is fantastic... Guys... Good company and an excellent Spritz!
PS.... You need good insurance for high water, :-)"
"The reviews indicate that the bar is a popular spot for enjoying drinks, including the aperol spritz, in a lively and friendly atmosphere. Customers appreciate the reasonable prices, with aperol spritz often mentioned at around 5 euros. The staff is frequently praised for being friendly and attentive, enhancing the overall experience. Most reviews express satisfaction with the aperol spritz, noting it as a highlight of their visit. However, there is some inconsistency, as one review mentions being told that spritzes were not available, which seems to be an exception rather than the rule.",True,4,The Irish Pub Venezia,"Snug Irish bar serving whiskey, Guinness & sandwiches, with live football on TV & outdoor tables.","Corte dei Pali, 3847, 30121 Venezia VE, Italy",+39 041 639 6692,http://www.theirishpubvenezia.com/,"Pub guiri donde beben los Erasmus.

Great place aperol 5 euros and open until 2am

A lovely evening around a spritz and some delicious cichetti with very friendly and attentive staff, I recommend, it's good to find a simple and inexpensive place in Venice where you're not afraid of being fooled like in some other restaurants in Venice üòÖ and 4 the Spritz üôÇ

I asked the owner for a spritz who told us they didn't do any. We had only drank a couple of spritzes.

Warm and welcoming pub with nice music in the background. Good Guinness and spritz.  The guys who served us were very nice and quick.  Good sandwiches. Excellent value for money.  Advised!

Very kind and excellent spritz served with chips

Sitio tranquilo para una parada de descanso. El Spritz 5 euros tama√±o grande y rico.

Spritz Hugo....espectacular 4,50‚Ç¨ y cerveza 3‚Ç¨ la ca√±a"
